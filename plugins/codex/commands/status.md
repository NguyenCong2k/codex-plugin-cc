Transport: pass the raw slash arguments through the quoted heredoc below. Choose a fresh delimiter if CODEX_ARGS appears as a complete line in the arguments. Never interpolate raw user text into shell quotes or a JavaScript expression.


Run this command once with Bash:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/codex-companion.mjs" status --arguments-stdin <<'CODEX_ARGS'
$ARGUMENTS
CODEX_ARGS
```

If the user did not pass a job ID:
- Render the command output as a single Markdown table for the current and past runs in this session.
- Keep it compact. Do not include progress blocks or extra prose outside the table.
- Preserve the actionable fields from the command output, including job ID, kind, status, phase, elapsed or duration, summary, and follow-up commands.

If the user did pass a job ID:
- Present the full command output to the user.
- Do not summarize or condense it.
